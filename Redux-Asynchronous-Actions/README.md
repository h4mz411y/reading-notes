# async actions in Redux

Media Server responds to an asynchronous action immediately. This means that you do not have to wait for a response if the action takes a long time. The response to an asynchronous action includes only a token.


By itself, a Redux store doesn't know anything about async logic. It only knows how to synchronously dispatch actions, update the state by calling the root reducer function, and notify the UI that something has changed. Any asynchronicity has to happen outside the store.

Earlier, we said that Redux reducers must never contain "side effects". A "side effect" is any change to state or behavior that can be seen outside of returning a value from a function. Some common kinds of side effects are things like:

* Logging a value to the console
* Saving a file
* Setting an async timer
* Making an AJAX HTTP request
* Modifying some state that exists outside of a function, or mutating arguments to a function
* Generating random numbers or unique random IDs (such as Math.random() or Date.now()).



***Redux middleware were designed to enable writing logic that has side effects.***

a Redux middleware can do anything when it sees a dispatched action: log something, modify the action, delay the action, make an async call, and more. Also, since middleware form a pipeline around the real store.dispatch function, this also means that we could actually pass something that isn't a plain action object to dispatch, as long as a middleware intercepts that value and doesn't let it reach the reducers.

Middleware also have access to dispatch and getState. That means you could write some async logic in a middleware, and still have the ability to interact with the Redux store by dispatching actions.

***Using Middleware to Enable Async Logic***

Let's look at a couple examples of how middleware can enable us to write some kind of async logic that interacts with the Redux store.

One possibility is writing a middleware that looks for specific action types, and runs async logic when it sees those actions, like these examples.


```js
import { client } from '../api/client'

const delayedActionMiddleware = storeAPI => next => action => {
  if (action.type === 'todos/todoAdded') {
    setTimeout(() => {
      // Delay this action by one second
      next(action)
    }, 1000)
    return
  }

  return next(action)
}

const fetchTodosMiddleware = storeAPI => next => action => {
  if (action.type === 'todos/fetchTodos') {
    // Make an API call to fetch todos from the server
    client.get('todos').then(todos => {
      // Dispatch an action with the todos we received
      storeAPI.dispatch({ type: 'todos/todosLoaded', payload: todos })
    })
  }

  return next(action)
}

```
