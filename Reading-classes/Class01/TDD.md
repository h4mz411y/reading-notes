## ** What is CI/CD**

Continuous integration and continuous delivery/continuous deployment are abbreviated as CI and CD. In its most basic form, continuous integration (CI) is a modern software development method that involves making small code changes regularly and consistently. CI-triggered automated build-and-test stages ensure that code changes merged into the repository are trustworthy. As part of the CD process, the code is then provided fast and effectively. In the software industry, the CI/CD pipeline refers to the automation that allows continuous code changes to be delivered quickly and securely to production from developers' desktops.
