## Access_control

* What is an access control list (ACL)?

An access control list (ACL) is a list of rules that specifies which users or systems are granted or denied access to a particular object or system resource. Access control lists are also installed in routers or switches, where they act as filters, managing which traffic can access the network.
* What are access control lists used for?

Access control lists are used for controlling permissions to a computer system or computer network. They are used to filter traffic in and out of a specific device. Those devices can be network devices that act as network gateways or endpoint devices that users access directly 


* How do ACLs work?

Each ACL has one or more access control entries (ACEs) consisting of the name of a user or group of users. The user can also be a role name, such as programmer or tester. For each of these users, groups or roles, the access privileges are stated in a string of bits called an access mask. Generally, the system administrator or the object owner creates the access control list for an object.

*  ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC)

Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.
