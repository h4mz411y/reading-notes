# SQL vs NoSQL Database

### ***SQL Database Examples*** :  MySQL / MS-SQL /  Oracle Express .

### ***No-SQL Database Examples*** :   MongoDB /  CouchDB /  Redis.

.


# High-Level Differences between the two
* SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.

* NoSQL databases are document-based, key-value pairs, graph databases, or wide-column stores, whereas SQL databases are table-based databases. This indicates that SQL databases represent data in the form of tables with n rows of data, but NoSQL databases are collections of key-value pairs, documents, graph databases, or wide-column stores that do not have standard schema definitions.

* SQL (structured query language) is a powerful language for defining and manipulating data in SQL databases. Queries in a NoSQL database are focused on document collecting. It's also referred to as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax for utilizing UnQL differs depending on the database.

#  Data Modeling Concepts

When working with SQL databases, creating diagrams of the database tables and their relationships is frequently useful. These can be completed during the design phase as part of your data modeling, or after the database has been constructed to describe the tables' dependencies. I'll occasionally utilize models to demonstrate my ideas as I discuss various concepts in my classes.

You can develop models with a variety of modeling applications, such as MySql Workbench, which not only creates attractive diagrams but also generates the code to create the database! In my instance, I'm going to draw my own diagrams because I'm trying to keep things simple and don't need to generate code. They're based on a few of different sources.
